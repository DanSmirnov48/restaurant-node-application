Changes of Menu page were made to improve UI and UX in terms of layout and navigation. Lunch and Dinner buttons moved towards the top middle.

Chefs Special page changes were due to inadequate positioning of the dishes at the design stage and would appear too large for a user.

Delete and Update buttons were placed for each dish card only for logged in staff, this is because Delete Dish page would prove to be unnecessary.

And and Update pages now include browse image files, this is needed to insert a dish image. 

Planing documentation did not include selected dish page, finished project includes the missing page.
